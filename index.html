    <div class="about">
      <p>Hello world! I'm a former Naval Officer turned software engineer,
        Charlotte, a.k.a. Chuck, Webster. I knew years prior to the end of my
        service that my future lay in software engineering, as it combined my
        loves of mathematics, language, and problem solving. My time in the
        Navy, surrounded in highly technical systems and machinery formed me
        into a technically curious individual, always wondering and
        exploring how and why things work the way they do.
      </p>
      <p>It is with great
        excitement that I embark on this lifelong learning journey of a career
        in software engineering through attending The Rithm School.
        In my formative years, I double majored at the Unites States Naval
        Academy, earning a Bachelors of Science in Economics and International
        Relations, as well as rowing on the varsity crew team. I went on to
        serve eleven years as a Naval Officer and ship driver. During this
        time, I served as a technical subject matter expert in navigation and
        the ship's weapon's systems, leading a team of over 50 personnel in
        the maintenance and operation of all weapons systems onboard.
      </p>
